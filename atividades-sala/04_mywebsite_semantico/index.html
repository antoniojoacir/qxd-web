            Hunter × Hunter (pronounced "hunter hunter"[4]) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by
            Yoshihiro Togashi. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March
            1998, although the manga has frequently gone on extended hiatuses since 2006. Its chapters have been
            collected in 38 tankōbon volumes as of September 2024. The story focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss
            who discovers that his father, who left him at a young age, is actually a world-renowned Hunter, a licensed
            professional who specializes in fantastical pursuits such as locating rare or unidentified animal species,
            treasure hunting, surveying unexplored enclaves, or hunting down lawless individuals. Gon departs on a
            journey to become a Hunter and eventually find his father. Along the way, Gon meets various other Hunters
            and encounters the paranormal.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hunter × Hunter was adapted into a 62-episode anime television series by Nippon Animation and directed by
            Kazuhiro Furuhashi, which ran on Fuji Television from October 1999 to March 2001. Three separate original
            video animations (OVAs) totaling 30 episodes were subsequently produced by Nippon Animation and released in
            Japan from 2002 to 2004. A second anime television series by Madhouse aired on Nippon Television from
            October 2011 to September 2014, totaling 148 episodes, with two animated theatrical films released in 2013.
            There are also numerous audio albums, video games, musicals, and other media based on Hunter × Hunter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media since April 2005. Both
            television series have been also licensed by Viz Media, with the first series having aired on the Funimation
            Channel in 2009 and the second series broadcast on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block from April 2016 to
            June 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hunter × Hunter has been a huge critical and financial success and has become one of the best-selling manga
            series of all time, having over 84 million copies in circulation by July 2022

        <h3>
            <b>Setting</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Hunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret
            treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals, and can also access locations that regulars cannot.[5] To
            obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which
            has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand.[6] A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a
            single star for making "remarkable achievements in a particular field"; they may then be upgraded to two
            stars for "holding an official position" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally
            upgraded to three stars for "remarkable achievements in multiple fields".[7]
        </p>
        <p>
            Nen (念) is the ability to control one's own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them,
            knowingly or not. There are four basic Nen techniques: Ten (纏) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening
            it for defense; Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one's presence and relieving
            fatigue; Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen; and Hatsu (發) is a person's specific use of Nen.[8] Nen
            users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and
            reinforce their natural physical abilities; Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies;
            Manipulators (操作系, Sōsakei) control objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or
            properties of their aura; Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists
            (特質系, Tokushitsukei) have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories.[9] A Nen user can
            enter into a Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their
            abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order
            to have an unbreakable chain that will fully restrain members of the Phantom Troupe, offered his life,
            should he use it on anyone other than its members.

        </h3>
        <p>
            The story follows Gon Freecss, a young boy raised believing both his parents were dead. After discovering
            from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that Ging is alive and a renowned Hunter, Gon leaves
            his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to undertake the Hunter Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) and
            follow in his father's footsteps.[11][12][13] During the exam, Gon befriends three other candidates:
            Kurapika, the last survivor of the Kurta clan seeking vengeance against the Phantom Troupe for slaughtering
            his people; Leorio, an aspiring physician pursuing the financial benefits of being a Hunter; and Killua
            Zoldyck, a former assassin from the infamous Zoldyck family.[12][13][5] Among the examinees is Hisoka, a
            deadly transmuter who takes a keen interest in Gon. After numerous trials, Gon and his friends pass the
            exam, except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant under his brother Illumi's influence and
            retreats to his family's estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            After reuniting with Killua, Gon and his companions separate temporarily. Gon and Killua travel to Heavens
            Arena (天空闘技場, Tenkū Tōgijō), a towering martial arts arena where they train under Wing, a master who teaches
            them Nen, a Qi-like energy that unlocks parapsychological abilities and is the Hunter Exam's true final
            requirement.[14] Later, the group reconvenes in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ, Yōkushin Shiti), where they clash
            with the Phantom Troupe. Kurapika kills two members and seals their leader Chrollo Lucilfer's powers but is
            forced to abandon further pursuit to rescue Gon and Killua.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gon and Killua later play Greed Island, a Nen-infused video game created by Ging, seeking clues to his
            whereabouts.[15] Under the tutelage of Biscuit Krueger, they refine their Nen abilities. Killua briefly
            departs to retake and pass the Hunter Exam before rejoining Gon to complete the game, earning artifacts that
            lead them to Ging. Instead, they reunite with Kite, who is researching a man-eating Chimera Ant queen in the
            Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region. The queen's offspring, having learned Nen by consuming Hunters,
            overthrow the nearby Republic of East Gorteau (東ゴルトー共和国, Higashi Gorutō Kyouwakoku). Despite the efforts of
            the Hunter Association, including its president Netero, the Ant King Meruem proves formidable. Netero
            ultimately defeats Meruem with a suicide bomb, while Gon, driven by vengeance, overexerts his Nen to kill
            the Ant Neferpitou, leaving him critically injured.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the Chimera Ant crisis, the Hunter Association's Zodiacs, including Ging, seek a new chairman. Killua
            retrieves his sister Alluka to heal Gon, overcoming his family's resistance and Illumi's interference. Gon
            eventually meets Ging, who reveals the purpose of his journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later, Netero's son Beyond organizes an expedition to the forbidden Dark Continent (暗黒大陸, Ankoku Tairiku),
            backed by the Kingdom of Kakin. The world's major powers permit the expedition under strict oversight, with
            the Zodiacs supervising Beyond. Kurapika and Leorio join the Zodiacs, replacing Ging and Pariston Hill, who
            form independent teams. Meanwhile, Chrollo regains his Nen and battles Hisoka, who, after being revived,
            begins assassinating Phantom Troupe members aboard Kakin's ship. Kurapika, aboard as bodyguard to Prince
            Wobble, seeks to reclaim the Kurta clan's stolen scarlet eyes from Prince Tserriednich.
