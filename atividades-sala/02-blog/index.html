            Inuyasha (犬夜叉, lit. "Dog Yaksha") is a Japanese manga series
            written and illustrated by Rumiko Takahashi. It was serialized in
            Shogakukan's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday from
            November 1996 to June 2008, with its chapters collected in 56
            tankōbon volumes. The series begins with Kagome Higurashi, a
            fifteen-year-old middle school girl from modern-day Tokyo who is
            transported to the Sengoku period after falling into a well in her
            family shrine, where she meets the half-dog demon, half-human
            Inuyasha. After the sacred Shikon Jewel re-emerges from deep inside
            Kagome's body, she inadvertently shatters it into dozens of
            fragments that scatter across Japan. Inuyasha and Kagome set out to
            recover Jewel's fragments, and through their quest, they are joined
            by the lecherous monk Miroku, the demon slayer Sango, and the fox
            demon Shippō. Together, they journey to restore the Shikon Jewel
            before it falls into the hands of the evil half-demon Naraku.

            In contrast to the typically comedic nature of much of Takahashi's
            previous works, Inuyasha deals with a darker and more serious
            subject matter, using the setting of the Sengoku period to easily
            display the violent content while still retaining some comedic
            elements. The manga was adapted into two anime television series by
            Sunrise. The first series ran for 167 episodes on Yomiuri Television
            and Nippon Television from October 2000 to September 2004. The
            second series, Inuyasha: The Final Act, is a direct sequel that
            adapts the remainder of the manga. It ran for 26 episodes from
            October 2009 to March 2010. Four feature films and an original video
            animation (OVA) have also been released. Other merchandise includes
            video games and a light novel. An anime-original sequel spin-off
            television series, titled Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon, aired for
            two seasons from October 2020 to March 2022.

            Viz Media licensed the manga, the two anime series, and movies for
            North America. Both Inuyasha and Inuyasha: The Final Act aired in
            the United States on Adult Swim (and later on its revived Toonami
            block) from 2002 to 2015.

            By September 2020, Inuyasha had 50 million copies in circulation,
            making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. In 2002,
            the manga won the 47th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen
            category.
